Hello!

This is a project i mainly made for my entrepeneurship class, where i decide to make an app that could manage household inventories.
This app stores data for home inventory items such as food, drinks, cleaning item, or so on. There is a card that shows items that are about to expire or about to run out based on the quantity or the expiry date of each item. It can also shows a dashboard of expenses based on the total price of items inputted, and it (planned, but not yet implemented) can support a "Household" of users to manage inventories together.

I decide to put this in a repo so that i have something to populate this account, and also so that i am more motivated to do some code. Also, this project seems to show a good potential, especially with the feedbacks i got from people around me.

In the future, i plan to furnish the app even more, add a REST API gateaway as well as adding a mobile version (though as of writing i don't have a clear picture of how i would set it up), and update the features even more like adding a new way to add items to make it easier for users to use the app. Thou it might take a while as i will still be focusing on my homework or other tasks from my courses for now, so i might not be pushing as actively. But i will try my best!

If you who are reading this is interested to download and test this app, for installation i do not have anything specific other than to install django and to use a venv when installing. I have not list a step - by - step guide on how to install it yet, as there also might be some more stuffs that i will add like for example REST api to connect to a mobile version of the app. In the meantime, you can refer to this video on how to install it, as this video is the reference i used when setting up the project in the first place.
